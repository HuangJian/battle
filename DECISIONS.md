## 1. Sprite Rendering: SVG → Pre-Rasterized Cache

**Decision:** All sprites are hand-authored SVG (96×96 viewBox), registered in `SPRITE_URLS`,
pre-rasterized at load time by `SpriteCache` into DPR-scaled bitmaps. No PNG assets.

**Rationale:** Zero binary assets, theme colors applied at draw time. Future bitmap
sprites extend the registry without replacing it.

---

## 2. Audio: Web Audio API Synthesis

**Decision:** All sound effects synthesized at runtime via Web Audio API. No audio files.

**Rationale:** Zero audio assets, retro 8-bit aesthetic, no external dependency.

---

## 3. Tile System: 26×26 Sub-block Grid

**Decision:** 26×26 grid of 16px sub-blocks. Tanks = 2×2 sub-blocks (32×32px). Playfield = 416×416px.

**Rationale:** Matches classic Battle City proportions. Sub-block granularity enables precise brick destruction.

---

## 4. Stage Data: TypeScript Config (not JSON)

**Decision:** Stage data in TypeScript config files (`src/config/stages.ts` + `stageData.ts`).
No async loading needed.

**Rationale:** Type safety, IDE autocompletion, bundled at build time. JSON-compatible structure
enables future externalization via `fetch()`.

---

## 5. Classic Stages: 35 Authentic NES Layouts

**Decision:** Ship 35 original Famicom stages. Raw 13×13 numeric grids in `stageData.ts`
decoded to 26×26 char grids by `stages.ts`. Enemy forces from authentic data.

**Rationale:** Authentic layouts with partial brick/steel pieces preserved losslessly.
Data is diffable against reference; appending a stage = adding a grid row.

---

## 6. Movement: Perpendicular Axis Snapping

**Decision:** Perpendicular axis snapped to nearest 16px cell boundary every frame.

**Rationale:** Enables navigation through 1-tile corridors. Turning only at grid intersections (classic behavior).

---

## 7. Enemy AI: Tactical Intelligence Framework

**Decision:** Every enemy runs one pipeline: `Perception → Situation → Goal → Decision → Action`.
Three time scales (strategic ~20s, tactical ~5s, reactive per-tick). Intelligence is config, not code
(`src/ai/config.ts`). Tiers: `none/rookie/soldier/veteran/commander`. Tier rolled at spawn
from per-difficulty distribution. Commander broadcasts influencing (non-controlling) directives.

**Rationale:** Data over code. New tier = one registry entry. Full detail in DECISIONS §29 and `docs/features.md` §4.

---

## 8. Game Loop: Fixed Timestep with Accumulator

**Decision:** Fixed 1000/60ms timestep, max 5 sim steps per render frame.

**Rationale:** Deterministic simulation, stable physics regardless of frame rate.

---

## 9. Input: Per-Frame Edge Detection + Last-Pressed-Wins

**Decision:** `endFrame()` clears edge state once per render frame. `moveStack` resolves
held keys by "last pressed wins" order.

**Rationale:** Per-frame edge detection for menus; last-pressed-wins for intuitive tank control.

---

## 10. Base Destruction: All Cells at Once

**Decision:** Any bullet hit on any base sub-block destroys all base sub-blocks simultaneously.

**Rationale:** Classic Battle City behavior — any base hit = game over.
