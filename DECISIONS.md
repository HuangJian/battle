# Design Decisions

> Key decisions made during MVP development, as requested.

---

## 1. Sprite Rendering: Programmatic Canvas Drawing

**Product spec says:** Assets = PNG + JSON

**Decision:** Draw all sprites programmatically using Canvas 2D primitives (rectangles, arcs, paths). No PNG assets.

**Rationale:**
- Keeps the MVP self-contained — no need to source or create bitmap assets
- Pixel-art style is fully achievable with canvas drawing
- Theme support is trivial: just change colors in the theme config
- Smaller bundle size (37KB vs. potentially MBs of PNGs)
- Future: can add PNG sprite support by extending SpriteFactory without changing game logic

## 2. Audio: Web Audio API Synthesis

**Product spec says:** Audio = HTML Audio / Howler.js

**Decision:** Use Web Audio API to synthesize 8-bit style sound effects at runtime. No audio files, no Howler.js dependency.

**Rationale:**
- Zero audio assets to manage
- Procedurally generated sounds (beeps, sweeps, noise) fit the retro aesthetic
- No additional dependency
- Future: can add Howler.js for music streaming without changing the AudioManager interface

## 3. Tile System: 26×26 Sub-block Grid

**Decision:** Use a 26×26 grid of 16px sub-blocks. Tanks are 2×2 sub-blocks (32×32px). Playfield = 416×416px.

**Rationale:**
- Matches classic Battle City proportions (13×13 tiles, each subdivided into 2×2)
- Sub-block granularity allows precise brick destruction
- 416×416 is a good internal resolution; CSS scales it up with `image-rendering: pixelated`
- 16px sub-blocks are large enough for clear visuals, small enough for satisfying destruction

---

## 4. Stage Data: TypeScript Config (not JSON)

**Product spec says:** Resources in JSON format (assets/maps/stage01.json)

**Decision:** Stage data is defined in TypeScript config files (`src/config/stages.ts`) for the MVP.

**Rationale:**
- TypeScript provides type safety and IDE autocompletion for stage data
- No async loading needed — stages are bundled at build time
- The data structure is JSON-compatible and can be extracted to `.json` files later
- Architecture supports the transition: just replace the import with a `fetch()` call

---

## 5. Movement Alignment: Perpendicular Axis Snapping

**Decision:** When a tank moves, the perpendicular axis is snapped to the nearest 16px cell boundary every frame.

**Rationale:**
- Ensures tanks can navigate through 1-tile-wide corridors
- Allows turning only at grid intersections (classic Battle City behavior)
- The snap distance is at most 8px, which is imperceptible at normal movement speeds
- Simpler than tracking "last turn position" and aligning on direction change

---

## 6. Enemy AI: Weighted Random Direction

**Decision:** Enemy AI uses a simple weighted random system:
- 30% chance: move toward player
- 20% chance: move toward base
- 50% chance: random direction
- Re-evaluate every 0.5–2.0 seconds

**Rationale:**
- Simple but produces believable, varied behavior
- Enemies naturally navigate toward objectives without complex pathfinding
- Different tank types (fast, power, armor) create gameplay variety through stats, not AI complexity
- Future: AI strategy interface is anticipated — `aiState` can be replaced with different strategies

---

## 7. Game Loop: Fixed Timestep with Accumulator

**Decision:** Use a fixed timestep (1000/60ms) with an accumulator. Max 5 simulation steps per render frame.

**Rationale:**
- Deterministic simulation (required for future replay system)
- Stable physics regardless of frame rate
- 5-step cap prevents spiral-of-death on slow devices
- Product spec requires 60 FPS — fixed timestep ensures consistent gameplay speed

---

## 8. Input: Per-frame Edge Detection

**Decision:** `endFrame()` is called once per render frame (not per simulation tick) to clear "just pressed" state.

**Rationale:**
- Menu navigation and state transitions need per-frame edge detection
- If cleared per-tick, multiple ticks per frame could miss input
- If never cleared (e.g., in menu state), keys would repeat every frame
- Calling once per frame at the end of the loop is the cleanest solution

---

## 9. Base Destruction: All Cells at Once

**Decision:** When a bullet hits any base sub-block, all base sub-blocks are destroyed simultaneously.

**Rationale:**
- In classic Battle City, any hit on the base ends the game
- The base is 2×2 sub-blocks; destroying one would leave a visual gap but the game should end immediately
- Destroying all cells ensures `isBaseDestroyed()` returns true on the next check
- The destroyed base is rendered as ruins for visual feedback
